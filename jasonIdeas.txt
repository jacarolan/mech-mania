Ideas:

Store opponent's stances when opponent was playing against you, use probablistic analysis to calculate expected value for each stance

Monster + Opponent Stance Function: Assume other player will try to beat monster, you play the thing that beats them

Raw node value based on value from monster and value from other player

----------------------------------------
DONE
----------------------------------------

Speed metric should be equal to (7 - speed), take into account the upper limit of speed

Make sure there's no division by 0

Speed weight should be based on number of turns left until duel

Total value = sum of (1/waittime)^(-length of shortest path to node) * relu(value of node)

JOE is doing: Move immediately after beating monster

JATIN is doing:
value from other player = - your loss + their loss
predicted damage = cbrt(r*p*s) * num
